# Cli

## Introduction

This is a command-line tool focused on diagnosing and providing suggestions and quick fixes to help you integrate infrastructures and enforce best practices in our workflows.

It is published as a package named `@ti-fe/cli`.

## Usage

### Install

Use yarn or whatever package manager you like:

```
yarn add --dev @ti-fe/cli
```

It provides two simple commands: `doctor` and `fix`.

For example, running `wi doctor`(wi for web infra) will scan the current directory and run a check of a list of rules and conventions then print the results and tips for quick fix.

`wi fix [scope]` would do the quick fix.

## Design Principles

This tool is not designed to be an all-in-one, highly integrated black box. We already have decent tools for almost every use case. Babel, Eslint, Webpack, Vite, Prettier, Jest or any others you name it. In most cases, we have to spend lots of time on each one of them doing all kinds of configurations so they can be properly used in every single project. And as time passes, each project may change it, or bring in other new tools and so we have to do it again and again.

So we made this tool to ease the pain and every project could easily share and use consistent configurations with very little effort, perhaps one single command in your terminal would have done all the job for you.

Creating a wrapper around those libraries to build an unified tool is another way to make it but it'll be hard to customize and scale. For example, we may have already suffered the pain with react-scripts when we were trying to customize webpack config in create-react-app projects.
