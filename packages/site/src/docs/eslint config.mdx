# Eslint Config

## Introduction

[Eslint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) is an open source and fully pluggable JavaScript linter that can be used to statically analyzes code, quickly find and auto fix problems. It has a powerful customization ability from preprocessing code, using custom parsers, or even writing own rules that work alongside it's built-in rules.

Code linting is heavily used in every project of ours to find problematic patterns or code that smells bad.

The shared eslint config is published as a NPM package named `@ti-fe/eslint-config`.

## Usage

### Install manually

Since we write pretty much everything in TypeScript, so we'll have to install the parser for TypeScript code.

Install dependecies by running:

```shell
yarn add -dev eslint @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin
```

Install our shared lint config:

```shell
 yarn add --dev @ti-fe/eslint-config
````

Then create an `.eslintrc.js` in the root directory of your project, copy the followings to it:

```js
module.exports = {
  extends: ['@ti-fe/eslint-config'],
  env: {
    // Your custom env variables, e.g., browser: true, jest: true
  },
  globals: {
    // Your global variables
  },
  rules: {
    // Your custom rules.
  },
}
```

### Install with cli

Or you could use the cli tool to do all the job for you by install it with:

```shell
yarn add --dev @ti-fe/cli
```

and then run:

```shell
npx wi doctor
npx wi fix
```

The cli tool will check if linter is properly installed and configured and fix it for you if not. It will also add linting process to git pre-commit hook.


## Philosophy

### Seperation of concerns

import Link from '../components/Link'

All coding style-related rules will be handled by [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), see <Link href="#prettier-config">prettier config</Link> for more details.

### Values [ESLint's philosophy](https://eslint.org/docs/about/#philosophy)

Every rules is standalone and configurable individually.

### Not reinventing wheels

We build our own config rule set based on [alloy config](https://github.com/AlloyTeam/eslint-config-alloy). You can also customize and build your own rule set to meet the project needs.
