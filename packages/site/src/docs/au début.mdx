# Web Infra

## Get started

Web Infra is a collection of tools for building web based user interface. All tools are open sourced on GitHub and available as NPM packages under `@ti-fe` scope. You can navigate through sidebars to the left to learn the details of each package.

It is built by PingCAP front-end team and optimized for it's internal collaboration workflows.

## How to read documentation

To eliminate most of the type errors during build time and ship products with better quality to our end users, we wrote everything in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), an open-source language made by Microsoft which builds on JavaScript with static type definitions and annotations, it can be statically analysed and compiled to plain JavaScript. _You don't need to use TypeScript in order to use those tools_.

This website, including all the code samples throughout this site are also written in TypeScript.

TypeScript code looks just like modern ES2015+ code with additional type annotations, if you understand JavaScript, then you already understand most of the TypeScript code.

### A few examples

Variables always have type signatures that typically appear after colons.

```ts
// variables with type annotation
const name: string;
const active: boolean;
```

Interface can be used to describe the shape of objects.

```ts
// interface to describe the shape of objects
interface User {
  id: number
  name: string
  role: string
}
```

All functions are annotated with what kinds of data they accept and what kinds of data they return.

```ts
function updateUser(id: number, data: Partial<User>): Promise<void> {
  // implementation
}
```

Sometimes, we need to use a _type variable_ to capture the type of the argument and reuse it later, this is always in all-caps.

For example, a function that returns the same type of data it was provided:

```ts
function identity<T>(arg: T): T {
  return arg;
}
```

A class that holds a value:

```ts
class Box<T> {
  readonly private value: T

  constructor(value: T) {
    this.value = value
  }

  public getValue(): T {
    return this.value
  }
}
```
