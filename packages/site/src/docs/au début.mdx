# Web Infra

## Get started

Web Infra is a collection of tools for building web based user interface. All tools are open sourced on GitHub and available as NPM packages under `@ti-fe` scope. You can navigate through sidebars to the left to learn the details of each package.

It is built by PingCAP front-end team and optimized for it's internal collaboration workflows.

## Coding Guideline

import Link from '../components/Link'

We use Prettier to automatically format code, see details at <Link href="#prettier-config">here</Link>. Also all code will be linted by Eslint when commit it to code base, you can find the shared eslint configuration at <Link href="#eslint-config">here</Link>.

There are some common practices were listed here:

- Use TypesScript by default, using JavaScript for some simple scripting is allowed but using it with `//@ts-check` is encouraged.

- Use `const` and `let`, declare all local variables with `const` by default, unless a variable needs to be reassigned. The `var` keyword must not be used.

- Every local variable declaration declares only one variable: declarations such as `let a = 1, b = 2;` are not preferred.

- Use named exports by default, only use default export when exporting a React component.

```typescript
// AVOID
export default function someFunction() {}
```

```typescript
// PREFER
export function someFunction() {}
```

- Avoid `any` where possible. If you find `any`s in code, consider replace it with whether a generic or `unknown`.

- Generally avoid adding boolean arguments to a method in cases where that argument means "do something extra". In these cases, prefer breaking the behavior up into different functions.

```typescript
// AVOID
function turnLeftOrRight(dir: boolean = false) {
  // ...
}
```

```typescript
// PREFER
function turn(dir: 'left' | 'right' = 'left') {
  // ...
}
```

- Name classes based on their responsibility. Names should capture what the code _does_,
  not how it is used:

```typescript
/** NO: */
class DefaultRouteReuseStrategy {}

/** YES: */
class NonStoringRouteReuseStrategy {}
```

- Use `readonly` members wherever possible.

- The name of a method should capture the action performed _by_ that method rather than describing when the method will be called. For example:

```typescript
/** AVOID: does not describe what the function does. */
handleClick() {
  // ...
}

/** PREFER: describes the action performed by the function. */
checkClusterInfo() {
  // ...
}
```


## Workflow

For our common git workfolw, you'll have to fork your repo first, then create a git branch from where you want to base your work, usually master.

After that, you can start to work on it, write code, add test cases, and commit your work (see below for message format).

Before you want to commit your work, it is a must to run lints and formatters. Generally they will be in git hooks. And also remember to run tests and make sure all of them will pass.

Before push, run `git pull --rebase` or `git pull upstream master--rebase`(assuming you have remote repo named as upstream, change it accodingly!) to make sure you have latest changes in local, resolve conflicts if there are any.

It is encouraged to **always use _rebase_** to keep commit history clean.

Now you can push changes to the forked repo under your name instead of the original one. Your PR will be reviewed by two maintainers, who may request some changes. Once you've made changes, your PR must be re-reviewed and approved.

If PR is outdated or there are conflicts, you can rebase (or merge) and resolve them locally. Then force push to your PR branch. You do not need to get re-review just for resolving conflicts, but you should request re-review if there are significant changes.

Our CI will test all pull requests. If all tests passed and got an approval, reviewers will merge your PR.

### Commit message

We use conventional commit message. To enforce this commit message format, this commit lint tool will be used.

The commit message should be structured as follows:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

The commit contains the following structural elements, to communicate intent to the consumers of your library:

`fix`: a commit of the type fix patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with PATCH in Semantic Versioning).

`feat`: a commit of the type feat introduces a new feature to the codebase (this correlates with MINOR in Semantic Versioning).

**BREAKING CHANGE**: a commit that has a footer `BREAKING CHANGE:`, or appends a `!` after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change (correlating with `MAJOR` in Semantic Versioning). A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any type.

types other than fix: and feat: are allowed, for example `@commitlint/config-conventional` (based on the the Angular convention) recommends build:, `chore:`, `ci:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`, `test:`, and others.

footers other than BREAKING CHANGE: [<]description[>] may be provided and follow a convention similar to git trailer format.

### Example

Commit message with description and breaking change footer

```
feat: allow provided config object to extend other configs

BREAKING CHANGE: `extends` key in config file is now used for extending other config files
```

Commit message with `!` to draw attention to breaking change

```
refactor!: drop support for Node 6
```

### Why conventional commits

- Automatically generating CHANGELOGs.
- Automatically determining a semantic version bump (based on the types of commits landed).
- Communicating the nature of changes to teammates, the public, and other stakeholders.
- Triggering build and publish processes.
- Making it easier for people to contribute to your projects, by allowing them to explore a more structured commit history.

For example, this repo uses changeset and conventional-changelog-cli to generate changelog automatically, you can find details in the [configuration file](https://github.com/ti-fe/web-infra/blob/master/.github/workflows/changelog.yml).

## Naming conventions

For namings, we follow [Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Coding-guidelines](Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Coding-guidelines) in general. For example:

Classes:

- use PascalCase, the first letter is always uppercase for types.
- Example: `Car`, `ApplicationMetadata`.
- In general prefer single words, so it can be expanded by prepend or append other words.
- Should not end with `Impl` or any other word which describes a specific implementation of an interface.

Interfaces:

- Follow the same rules as Classes.
- Should not have `I` or `Interface` in the name or any other way of identifying it as an interface. Naming is hard and developers are lazy, this helps us to avoid bad namings. There are some disscussions about this at [TypeScript-Handbook/issues/121](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-Handbook/issues/121) and [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31876947/confused-about-the-interface-and-class-coding-guidelines-for-typescript/41967120#41967120).

Methods and functions:

- Example: `bootstrap`, `someMethod`.
- Should be camel case with first letter lowercase.

Constants:

- Should be all uppercase with SNAKE_CASE.
- Example: `CORE_DIRECTIVES`.

React Components:

- use PascalCase like classes.
- Example: `UsageOverview`.
- One component per file, use the component name as file name, if it is a directory, use it as directory name and export component in index.ts.

Hooks:

- Use camel case, always starts with `use`.
- Example: `useSomeHook`.


## How to read documentation

To eliminate most of the type errors during build time and ship products with better quality to our end users, we wrote everything in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), an open-source language made by Microsoft which builds on JavaScript with static type definitions and annotations, it can be statically analysed and compiled to plain JavaScript. _You don't need to use TypeScript in order to use those tools_.

This website, including all the code samples throughout this site are also written in TypeScript.

TypeScript code looks just like modern ES2015+ code with additional type annotations, if you understand JavaScript, then you already understand most of the TypeScript code.

### A few examples

Variables always have type signatures that typically appear after colons.

```ts
// variables with type annotation
const name: string;
const active: boolean;
```

Interface can be used to describe the shape of objects.

```ts
// interface to describe the shape of objects
interface User {
  id: number
  name: string
  role: string
}
```

All functions are annotated with what kinds of data they accept and what kinds of data they return.

```ts
function updateUser(id: number, data: Partial<User>): Promise<void> {
  // implementation
}
```

Sometimes, we need to use a _type variable_ to capture the type of the argument and reuse it later, this is always in all-caps.

For example, a function that returns the same type of data it was provided:

```ts
function identity<T>(arg: T): T {
  return arg;
}
```

A class that holds a value:

```ts
class Box<T> {
  readonly private value: T

  constructor(value: T) {
    this.value = value
  }

  public getValue(): T {
    return this.value
  }
}
```
